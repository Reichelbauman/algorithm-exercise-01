Sumarize numbers

Build a function that sumarize numbers (an array of numbers)

steps:
1. create a new branch
2. ask Felipe @gelipundio to give you access to the repository as collaborator
3. install node modules `npm install`
4. create a file called `solution.js`
5. export a function called `sumarize`
6. code solution inside `sumarize` function
7. test your solution with the command `npm run test`
8. once your solution is working fine, push your branch (do not create Pull Request)

Example:
you are going to get an input like:
````
[5, 2, 1, 5]
````

when you run your function
```
sumarize([5, 2, 1, 5])
```

your function should return:
````
13
````

Hints:
- do you know what is an acumulator variable?
- do you know how to iterate an array?
